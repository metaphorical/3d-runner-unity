# 3d runner game project

This is one of my side projects that came out of the small but perfect youtube course that I took to understand how unity works. 

> [Find the mini course here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&ab_channel=BrackeysBrackeys) - it will help you understand Unity, and if you got programming background, it will open lots of stuff for you.

The game itself is simple - it is 3rd person runner game on the 2d plain. 

To continue the excercise I am planning to give it all the necessary coomponents and features of a full game and publish it on Play Store :D 

There is lots to do, tho, so do not wait up.

[You can check this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Z1iJiTGU/3d-runner) to see how am I doing.

> By the way, if you want to start with unity (with C#, not fake JS), I recommend looking at [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA). He stopped creating content, so it will over time be outdated, but he is great and worth watching.
